Game Overview:
"3D Tank Battle Arena" is a dynamic 3D tank combat game where the player controls a tank and battles against AI-controlled enemy tanks in a jungle-themed arena. The player must navigate the battlefield, avoid obstacles, and defeat enemy tanks while surviving through various waves. The game also features power-ups, a fighter plane, and multiple camera views.

Game Features:
Player Tank: Controlled by arrow keys, with separate turret control. The tank can move in all directions and fire bullets at enemies.

Enemy Tanks: AI-controlled tanks that patrol the area and chase the player when in close range. Each enemy tank has its own health and can fire back at the player.

Fighter Plane: A plane flies across the battlefield and can be controlled by the player to fire at enemy tanks.

Obstacles: The game includes obstacles like trees and rocks that the player and enemies must avoid.

Power-ups: Randomly spawned power-ups that can boost the player's health, speed, or fire rate.

Camera Views: Three camera modes are available:

First-Person: View from the player's turret.

Third-Person: View behind the player's tank.

Top-Down: Bird's eye view of the battlefield.

Scoreboard: Displays the player's lives and the number of remaining enemies.

Visual Effects: Orange flash effects are triggered when tanks are hit or destroyed.

Pause Menu: The game can be paused with the 'P' key.

Game Over: The game ends when the player loses all lives or defeats all enemies.

Controls:
Arrow Keys: Rotate the player's turret left/right.

W: Move the tank forward.

S: Move the tank backward.

A: Rotate the player's tank left.

D: Rotate the player's tank right.

Spacebar: Fire the player's bullets.

F: Command the fighter plane to fire at the closest enemy tank.

C: Switch between different camera modes (first-person, third-person, top-down).

P: Pause the game.

S (in menu): Start a new game.

Q: Quit the game.


Game Modes:
Menu: The game starts here, and you can either start a new game (press 'S') or quit (press 'Q').

Paused: You can pause the game during gameplay by pressing 'P' and resume with 'P' again.

Playing: The main game mode where you battle enemy tanks.

Game Over: The game ends either when you lose all your lives or defeat all enemies. A "You Won!" or "Game Over!" message is shown.

How to Play:
Tank Controls: Use the WASD keys to move the tank and rotate the turret using the arrow keys.

Enemy Tanks: The enemy tanks will patrol, chase, and fire at you when you're in range.

Fighter Plane: Press 'F' to command the fighter plane to target and fire at enemy tanks.

Power-ups: Pick up random power-ups like health boosts, speed boosts, or rapid fire to enhance your tank's abilities.

Visual Effects:
When a tank is hit, an orange flash effect appears at the point of impact.

The fighter plane also fires a projectile when the player commands it.

Pause and Resume:
You can pause the game during gameplay by pressing 'P', and resume it by pressing 'P' again.

Game Boundaries:
The game world is bounded by a predefined area where you can't go beyond the boundaries.

Collisions with obstacles like trees and rocks will stop the player's tank movement.

Development Notes:
This game is built using Python with PyOpenGL for rendering 3D graphics.

The tank's movement, turret control, and enemy AI are implemented using basic logic with random behavior for enemy patrol.

The game’s logic is based on the tank’s movement and firing mechanics, with health and bullet collision detection.
